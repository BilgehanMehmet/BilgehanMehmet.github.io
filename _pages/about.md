I am a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at the Computer Vision Group, Australian National University, under the supervision of Dr. Dylan Campbell, Prof. Hongdong Li, and Prof. Stephen Gould. 

My ultimate goal is to build machines that learn as efficiently as humans and understand the 3D world. To that end, I am interested in advancing the frontiers of representation learning, scalable paradigms, and architectures for 3D vision and generative modelling. My work aims to push the boundaries of research in feed-forward 3D reconstruction methods and generative models for video understanding. 

Previously, I earned my MSc in Advanced Controls from The University of Manchester in 2021, honoured with the Top Student of the Year Award and Research Excellence Award. I earned my BEng in Mechatronics from the University of Manchester in 2019. Before my master's, I had the great privilege of working as a software engineer on jet engines at Rolls-Royce, UK. 

My journey with deep learning began in 2018 with my undergraduate thesis, which explored one-shot learning with Convolutional Siamese Neural Networks, under the supervision of Prof. Hujun Yin, and my master's thesis investigated deep reinforcement learning for optimising the collective flocking behaviour in swarm robotics, under the supervision of Prof. Farshad Arvin. 

I am always interested in collaborations and available for a chat. Feel free to contact me.
